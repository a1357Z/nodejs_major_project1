Launch the installed distro from your Windows Store and then install redis-server. The following example works with Ubuntu (youâ€™ll need to wait for initialization and create a login upon first use):

> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get upgrade
> sudo apt-get install redis-server
> redis-cli -v
> Restart the Redis server to make sure it is running:
> sudo service redis-server restart
> Execute a simple Redis command to verify your Redis server is running and available:
> $ redis-cli

> run the gulp using command 'gulp command'
